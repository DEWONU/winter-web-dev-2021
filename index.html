   <h2 class="underline"> So what is HTML?</h2>
   <p>HTML is a <strong> markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content. It consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. For example if we wanted a line to stand by itself  we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags.</p>

   <p>The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:</p>
   <ol>
       <li> <strong> The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
<li> <strong> The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ol>

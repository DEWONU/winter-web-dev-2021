    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO CSS</h1>
    <P>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. For example How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? </P>

    <h2>What is CSS?</h2
    
    <p>CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. When using css to style a website it has to be applied to the html file.
        <br>
        <br>
        To make the code work, we still need to apply th CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML.
<br>
   <br> 
   <br>
   <ol>
       <li>Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head (between the head and head tags):</li>
       (link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet") (However it has to be in between greater and lesser than tags.)
       <li>Save index.html and load it in your browser.</li>
<br>
       P.S Only then will the effected style start to show on the webpage.
   </ol>
    </p>
<h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>

alt="Anatomy of a css ruleset">

<p>The rule set has 4 individual parts namely:
    <ul>
        <li>Selector :
            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, "p" elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
                <li>Declaration :
                    This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
                  <li>Properties :
                    These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the "p" elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
                 <li>Property value
                    To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    NOTE: <ul>
        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Modification of multiple property values in a rule set can be achieved by using semi colons like this :</strong> 
    <br>
    p {
        color: red;
        width: 500px;
        border: 1px solid black;}
        <br>
        <br>
      <strong>Also multiple elements can be selected and a single rule set can be applied as in :</strong> 
      p, li, h1 {
        color: red; }
<h4>Different Types of Selectors.</h4>
<p>The examples above uses the "element selector". However, other selectors exist. For example
<ul><li>ID selector: The element on the page with the specified ID.</li>
<li>Class selector: The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page.</li>
<li>Others include: Attribute selector and Pseudo-class selector</li>

</ul>

<h2>Positioning, Styling, Fonts and text  </h2>
<p>Fonts can be changed using font-size: 10px;
    font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; eIn this section we also use:

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  OTHER ITEMS ON A PAGE CAN ALSO BE ADJUSTED e.g
  <ul>
   <li> width (of an element).</li>
    <li>   background-color, the color behind an element's content and padding.</li>
    <li>  color, the color of an element's content (usually text).</li>
    <li>  text-shadow sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.</li>
   <li> display sets the display mode of an element.</li>
 </ul>
    </p>
